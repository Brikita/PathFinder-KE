            Why We Exist
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            Finishing high school often leaves young people with more questions than answers.
            With limited access to mentorship, relatable guidance, or career exposure, many are left making high-stakes decisions without enough clarity.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            PathFinder KE exists to bridge that gap. It transforms the stress of uncertainty into an interactive journey of discovery.
            Instead of guessing your way through the future, you get to explore it with intention.
            Try out paths, understand your strengths, see how different choices play out and unlock a direction that actually fits you.
